# library
A simple, interactive and frontend-only library project.

## Core Functionalities
- Add a new book to the library (title, author, number of pages and read status)
- Change a book's read status
- Remove a book from the library

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Future Refinements:
- Improve UI: follow the design image and add animations for creation, deletion...etc
- Add functionality to modify other book info, not just read status.

### How code is structured:
- Objects and object constructors
